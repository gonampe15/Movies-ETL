# Movies-ETL

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create one function that takes in the three files (Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data) and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Results

After completing the extract, transform, and load process, we have a database with two tables: movies and ratings.
